# Hospital-Database-Management-System-for-COVID-19-Patients
As the Covid-19 pandemic unfolds across the United States, one of the greatest barriers we are encountering is the absence of credible and consistent data records. Tracking daily hospitalization data is a major step forward in quantifying the current impact on local hospital systems, modeling and forecasting future utilization needs, and tracking the rate of change in the disease severity. The database is designed to keep records of COVID-19 patients, doctors and nurses in the hospital. It includes patientsâ€™ essential information, visit history, pre-test symptoms and underlying conditions if any. The database also includes hospital staff information, lab test results, and inventory of personal protective equipment (PPE) and Covid-19 medicine. XAMPP was used to build the application. The two essential components of XAMPP are Apache, which is used to create the local server, and MySQL which is used as a database management system for the application. PHP which is a server scripting language is used to connect to and manipulate the database. The content and structure of the application web pages were designed using HTML and CSS.
